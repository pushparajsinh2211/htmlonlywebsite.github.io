        As the son of <b>Odin, king of the Norse gods</b>, Thor will soon inherit the throne of <b>Asgard</b> from his aging father. However, on the day that he is
        to be crowned, Thor reacts with brutality when the gods' enemies, the Frost Giants, enter the palace in violation of their treaty. As
        punishment, Odin banishes Thor to Earth. While Loki, Thor's brother, plots mischief in Asgard, Thor, now stripped of his powers, 
        faces his greatest threat.
